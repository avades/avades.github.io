			<p>My Dissertation „Metabolic Aesthetics of Metabolic Processes has been published with Meson Press.</p> <!-- the "p" tag is for text -->
			<h2>What is it about?</h2> <!-- the "h2" tag is for a second-level header -->
			<p>Simultaneously speculative and inspired by everyday experiences, this volume develops an aesthetics of metabolism that offers a new perspective on the human-environment relation, one that is processual, relational, and not dependent on conscious thought. In art installations, design prototypes, and research-creation projects that utilize air, light, or temperature to impact subjective experience the author finds aesthetic milieus that shift our awareness to the role of different sense modalities in aesthetic experience. Metabolic and atmospheric processes allow for an aesthetics besides and beyond the usually dominant visual sense.</p>
			<h2>Some Images from Case Studies</h2>
